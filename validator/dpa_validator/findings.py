"""Finding dataclass — a single validator output entry.

Severity is the GATE ("does this stop the job?"); priority is an optional risk
grading that never affects the gate (D-WS3-02). This axis is the deterministic
validator's own diagnostics about the SIDECAR file only — it is not a legal
risk register (dpa-art28 has none of its own; the Art. 28(3)(a)-(h) coverage
table's PASS/WEAK/GAP/DEFECT vocabulary lives in the sidecar's own
`art28_coverage[]` field, untouched by this gate vocabulary, per D-WS3-03).
